# PG County Budget Spending 2018
## Project Description
PG County Budget Spending 2018 app hopes to solve the information problem of displaying how Prince George’s County 
spends their fiscal year budget through each agency in the county. Currently, there is only a dataset that will 
display this information. While accuracy is not the issue, understanding the significance of a lot of the information 
is an issue. We hope to find a better way of displaying this information so that the people of Prince George’s County 
can understand and see where spending is allocated to and hopefully help future adjustments and changes. Additionally, 
we hope this will encourage more specific data entry in the future. Information about the spending currently is very 
vague, and we hope that providing a new way to display spending will encourage better data entry so that it can be 
better understood and defended if necessary.
