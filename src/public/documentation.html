            Our group hopes to solve the information problem of displaying how Prince George’s County 
            spends their fiscal year budget. Currently, there is only a dataset that will display this 
            information. While accuracy is not the issue, understanding the significance of a lot of the 
            information is an issue. We hope to find a better way of displaying this information so that 
            the people of Prince George’s County can understand and see where spending is allocated to and 
            hopefully help future adjustments and changes. Additionally, we hope this will encourage more 
            specific data entry in the future. Information about the spending currently is very vague, and 
            we hope that providing a new way to display spending will encourage better data entry so that it 
            can be better understood and defended if necessary.
